      me at the dkb concert fighting for barricade cuz i lowkey need that
    </h1>
    <p>unfortunately i really don't play about this group i have reached 5000 plays on their song coco colada and i'm 100% sure they've seen my impact because they didn't perform their other song from that same album which is significantly more iconic in terms of which song the fandom likes better. i think i win. thank you dkb for noticing my impact on your streams. hope i tripled your paycheck! anyways i didn't really know what to do with this project i actually really felt like i was being ragebaited harder with each second i spent staring at this code so i think i channeled my anger into the project by making myself explode into combat with another bb but it's okay cuz i win these.</p>
